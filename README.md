# The Office Coffee Menu

Odin Project Restaurant Page assignment [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page]

This project is a simple, dynamic website for a fictional restaurant, "The Office Coffee." It was created to practice modern JavaScript development workflows, including the use of npm, webpack, and GitHub Pages. 

## Overview

"The Office Coffee Menu" is a web application that allows users to navigate through a restaurant page to view home, menu, and contact information. The web content is dynamically rendered using JavaScript, showcasing the ability to manipulate the DOM without the need for hard-coded HTML.

## Features

- Modular JavaScript structure.
- Dynamic content generation using JavaScript.
- Webpack for bundling modules.
- npm scripts for automation.
- Tabbed navigation to switch between the home, menu, and contact sections.
- Deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6: For writing modular and asynchronous code.
- npm: To manage project dependencies.
- webpack: To bundle JavaScript files.
- Babel: To use ES6 features in browsers that do not support them natively.
- CSS3: For styling.
- Git: For version control.
- GitHub Pages: To deploy the live website.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, key web development concepts were reinforced, including:

- npm for managing libraries and dependencies.
- webpack for module bundling and asset management.
- The importance of `.gitignore` to maintain a clean repository.
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript to create a dynamic user experience.
- Modular code organization to improve readability and maintainability.
- Event handling for interactive user interfaces.
- Deployment of a web application using GitHub Pages.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules.
3. Use `npm run build` to build the project with webpack.
4. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser to view the project locally.
